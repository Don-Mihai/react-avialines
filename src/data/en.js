Klyuev, Ruslan had helped rescue the icebreaker "Malygin," which had run aground near Spitsbergen. After completing that operation on April 24, Ruslan and the rescued Malygin set out for Murmansk. While awaiting the icebreaker Krasin, which was to tow them, Ruslan followed at slow speed. On the night of April 25, strong winds and snow began to ice up the ship, sharply reducing its stability. Listing heavily, it could only be briefly righted by turning bow-to-waves and chipping away ice. By evening the measures failed, water flooded the engine room, and around midnight Ruslan capsized and sank. Of the 22 crew who took to the lifeboats, only three were rescued by a Norwegian fishing vessel five days later.',
